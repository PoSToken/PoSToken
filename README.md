# Accelerator
The World's First Proof-of-Stake Smart Contract Token on Ethereum Backed By A Physical IT Asset

## What is Accelerator
The Accelerator Token is a proof-of-stake smart contract on Ethereum. It allows Accelerator
Token holders to mine more Accelerator Tokens at pre-defined rate. Mining is a very simple
process that takes place on Ethereum and can be done at home with little to no technical
knowledge.

## Physical IT Asset
Furthermore, Accelerator Tokens are also backed by a physical asset called the Accelerator
Network. The Accelerator Network is a cloud based mathematical super computer. Token
holders can spend their Accelerator Tokens for services offered by the Accelerator Network.
