# Accelerator
The World's First Proof-of-Stake Smart Contract Token on Ethereum Backed By A Physical IT Asset and Transactional System

Ethereum can be used in industries such as insurance, healthcare, real estate, entertainment, scientific research, and much more.  But due to technical obstacles in scalability it may not be adopted by most businesses.  Acceleratorâ€™s goal is to break through fundamental blockchain barriers and bridge the gap between emerging technology and widespread adoption in business.  By not only increasing capacity but also speeding up adoption by providing value added services.

## What is Accelerator
The Accelerator Token is a proof-of-stake smart contract on Ethereum.  It allows Accelerator Token holders to mine more Accelerator Tokens at pre-defined rate.  Mining is a very simple process that takes place on Ethereum and can be done at home with little to no technical knowledge. 

## Physical IT Asset
Furthermore, Accelerator Tokens are also backed by a physical asset called the Accelerator Network.   The Accelerator Network is a cloud based mathematical super computer and transaction system.  Token holders can spend their Accelerator Tokens for services offered by the Accelerator Network.  The main purpose of the Accelerator Network is to speed up Ethereum by offering a high speed off-chain transaction system that only uses the main Ethereum blockchain to handle disputes.
